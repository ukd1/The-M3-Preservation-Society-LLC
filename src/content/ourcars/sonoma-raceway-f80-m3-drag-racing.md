There's something inherently exciting about lining up at a drag strip, especially when you're behind the wheel of a machine as finely tuned as a manual F80 M3. In 2019, we had the incredible opportunity to take this beast to Sonoma Raceway, and let me tell you, it was an adrenaline-fueled day to remember.

The Anticipation

Sitting at the starting line, the air heavy with the scent of burnt rubber and high-octane fuel, you can't help but feel a connection with every M3 that has come before. The manual gearbox gives you a tactile control that's increasingly rare in today's world of paddle-shifters and automatics.

The Roar

As the light turns green, the M3's twin-turbo inline-6 roars to life, a symphony of power and precision. The manual gearbox allows for a level of driver engagement that's sublime, reminding you why the M3 has always been the benchmark for sports sedans.

The Aftermath

Crossing the finish line, you realize that this car isn't just a piece of machinery; it's a piece of history. At the M3 Preservation Society, we're all about cherishing these moments and preserving the legacy of these incredible cars.

Your Turn

Whether you've experienced the thrill of the drag strip or are just dreaming about it, we'd love to hear from you. Join us and let's keep the spirit of the M3 alive and roaring.
